# Web Design project - Web Visualization Dashboard

## Summary

In this project I am tasked with demonstrating how HTML and CSS can be applied to visualize data in a modern and creative way. Using Data visualizations that I created using a jupyter notebook and python APIs I was able to create a web page dashboard as well as several landing pages for specific visualizations to be analyzed in an interactive way through the suffisticated navigation bar. Using this navigation bar the user can jump between multiple pages and visualizations and read the analysis of the data and processes involved in creating the visualizations.

The Navagation bar includes buttons that are labeled with the specific visualization landing page that it corresponds to as well as a dropdown menu that is also labeled with those same pages.
The Home page also lends itself to interactivity as the images can be clicked and sends the user to the specific landing page that has a more in-depth look at the visualization.

Although, there are much more modern and streamlined tools that can be used in order to visualize data such as tableau and javascript that add more ability to interact. This project showcases an understanding of basic HTML and CSS capabilities.
